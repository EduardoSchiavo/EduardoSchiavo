## Hi there, I'm Eduardo 👋

 I work as a Senior Backend Engineer, specializing in streaming and data-intensive
 applications.
 I enjoy getting my hands dirty on the frontend when the need arises, and I'm always happy to
 learn new things.

 - 🔭 I'm currently working on the backend for [Quick
 Tabletop](https://github.com/EduardoSchiavo/quick-tabletop), a tool for managing tabletop
 RPGs.
 - 🌱 I'm currently learning Go and constantly deepening my knowledge of distributed systems
 and high-throughput architectures.
